# Code for generating figure panels in the fan-shaped body (FB) section
Below is a guide for identifying which notebooks were used for which figure panels.

**FBFigure-ColConnectivity.Rmd**: Connectivity graphs and matrices, function to display one, two, or three step connections, connectivity thresholds, dendrograms, and clustering
* Figure 33 A: Connectivity graph
* Figure 33 B: Step counting between types
* Figure 33 C: Connectivity matrix
* Figure 33 figure supplement 1 A: Connectivity matrix
* Figure 33 figure supplement 1 B: Number of types in a connectivity matrix as a function of the % of total neurons within that type that must be connected
* Figure 33 figure supplement 2 A: Dendrograms
* Figure 33 figure supplement 2 B: Clustering by cosine distance
