# Code for generating figure panels in the Discussion section
Below is a guide for identifying which notebooks were used for which figure panels.

**PB-FBBump.Rmd**: Simulations that assume a von Mises shaped bump of activity in the EPG neurons and propage it downstream by using the EM connectivity matrices as weights
* Figure 70 figure supplement 2 A: Simulated bump of activity
* Figure 70 figure supplement 2 B: Simulated bump of activity
* Figure 70 figure supplement 2 C: Simulated bump of activity

**FBFigure-BumpToPFLs.Rmd**: Simulations that assume a von Mises shaped bump of activity in the EPG neurons and propage it downstream by using the EM connectivity matrices as weights. The activity is then summed across all inputs and displayed as a function of the location of the peak of the EPG activity in the EB
* Figure 73 figure supplement 1 A: Connectivity matrix with synaptic weights
* Figure 73 figure supplement 1 B: Simulated activity
* Figure 73 figure supplement 1 C: Connectivity matrix with synaptic weights
* Figure 73 figure supplement 1 D: Simulated activity

**CX_RNN_Layout.Rmd**: Display selected CX connectivity as a RNN, as a force-directed network, and as both shuffled and aligned connectivity matrices
* Figure 75 A: Recurrent neural network diagram
* Figure 75 B: Connectivity graph laid out as a force-directed network
* Figure 75 C: Shuffled and aligned connectivity matrices
* Figure 75 figure supplement 1: Shuffled and aligned connectivity matrices
