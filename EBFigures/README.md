# Code for generating figure panels in the ellipsoid body (EB) section
Below is a guide for indentifying which notebooks were used for which figure panels.

### Main figures and supplemental information
**EB_synapseDistributions.Rmd**: Generate visualizations of synapse locations shown in Figure 10 and Figure 10 figure supplements.

2D histograms (see section 3a below)
* Figure 10 B (ER4m)
* Figure 10 figure supplement 1 (ring neurons)
* Figure 10 figure supplement 2 (columnar neurons)
* Figure 10 figure supplement 3 (EXR neurons)

Normalized synapse density plots in slices through the EB (see section 3b)
* Figure 10 C-E
* Figure 10 figure supplement 4

**EB_connectivityGraphsAndMatrix.Rmd**: Generate connectivity graph and matrix of connectivity
* Figure 10 F: connectivity matrix
* Figure ...

**EPGmorphology.Rmd**: ...  (maybe rename since the same notebook is used for EL?)

### Supplemental information only
**....Rmd**: ...
