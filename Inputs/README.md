## Guide for indentifying which notebooks were used for which figure panels

### Main figures and SI
**Inputs-Summary.Rmd**: Generate the summary statistics for figure 5. Uses data generated by **Inputs-Core.Rmd**, which should be executed first (and is computationally intensive)
* Figure 5B
* Figure 5 figure supplement 1 A and B

**Inputs-Figure-DivConv.Rmd**: ???

**AVP_connectivityGraphs-in-AOTU-and-BU.Rmd**: Create connectivity graphs in the AOTU (Figure 6) and BU (Figure 8)
* Figure 6C
* Figure 8B

**AVP_Synapse-densities-in-AOTU-and-BU.Rmd**: Generate normalized synapse densitites (and related plots) for various types in a given region
* Figure 6D
* Figure 6E (TBD what the final visualization will be)
* Figure 7C
* Figure 8C,D

**AVP_reorderedConnectivityMatrix_TuBu2ER.Rmd**: Code for generating regular and re-ordered connectivity matrix of connections from TuBu -> ER neurons in the right bulb (Figure 7 D).

**Mech_inputPathway.Rmd**: Code to generate the input pathway graph for putative mechanosensory information (Figure 9A).

**pieCharts**: Generation of pie chart plots as used in Figure 9B.

**Mech_synLocations.Rmd**: Code to generate visualizations of synapse distributions in 
* Figure 9E
* Figure 9 figure supplement 1 B
and a specilized connectivity matrix in
* Figure 9 figure supplement 1 A
