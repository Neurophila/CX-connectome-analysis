## Guide for indentifying which notebooks were used for which figure panels

### Main figures and SI
**AVP_connectivityGraphs-in-AOTU-and-BU.Rmd**: Create connectivity graphs in the AOTU (Figure 6) and BU (Figure 8)
* Figure 6C
* Figure 8B

**AVP_Synapse-densities-in-AOTU-and-BU.Rmd**: Generate normalized synapse densitites (and related plots) for various types in a given region
* Figure 6D
* Figure 6E (TBD what the final visualization will be)
* Figure 7C
* Figure 8C,D

### Supplemental information only
