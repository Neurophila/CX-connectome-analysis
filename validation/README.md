# Validation figures guide
The two notebooks in this folder are used to generate the two validation figures.

**validation-Figure3.Rmd** is used to generate figure 3 and supplement:
- Figure 3 A: rendering of example mesh at two levels of proofreading with synapses to known targets
- Figure 3 B: increase in synapse numbers between two levels of proofreading
- Figure 3 C: example fit of relative weights between two levels of proofreading
- Figure 3 D: slopes of all fits
- Figure 3 figure supplement 1: effect of the size of the neuron and the amount of change on the fit results

**validation-Figure4.Rmd** is used to generate figure 4 and supplement:
- Figure 4 Aii: synapse # difference between the glomeruli tested
- Figure 4 Aiii: example fit of relative weigths between the glomeruli tested
- Figure 4 Aiv: slopes of all fit
- Figure 4 Bii to Biv: same thing comparing FB column 3 to the rest of the FB
- Figure 4 figure supplement 1 A to D: same thing for control glomeruli
- Figure 4 figure supplement 1 E: comparisons of fit results distribution in the test and control case
